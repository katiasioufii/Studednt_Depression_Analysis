🧠 Depression Detection and Analysis Using Machine Learning
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict depression and analyze its relationship with various features, including academic pressure, suicidal thoughts, family mental illness history, and more.

📁 Dataset Overview
Target variable: Depression (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

Features include:

Demographics: Age, Gender, City

Education: CGPA, Degree, Academic Pressure

Lifestyle: Sleep Duration, Work/Study Hours, Dietary Habits

Mental Health Indicators: Suicidal Thoughts, Family History, Financial Stress, Job/Study Satisfaction

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Removed irrelevant or noisy values (e.g., inconsistent city names).

Converted categorical variables using LabelEncoder.

Normalized numerical columns using StandardScaler.

Dropped unnecessary columns like City, Gender, and Work Pressure in the final model.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis
Analyzed the distribution of depression across:

Cities

Degree levels (e.g., Class 12, B.Tech)

Gender

Explored the relationship between:

Suicidal thoughts & family history of mental illness

Family history & depression

Key Insights:

24% of depressed individuals are in Class 12.

85.44% of depressed individuals report having suicidal thoughts.

Family history of mental illness is strongly correlated with both depression and suicidal ideation.

🤖 Machine Learning Models Used
Model	Accuracy	F1 Score
Logistic Regression	~84%	0.87
SVM	~84%	0.86
Random Forest	~83%	0.86
Gradient Boosting	~84%	0.86
K-Nearest Neighbors	~81%	0.84

Best Performance: Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, and Voting Classifier

🧪 Ensemble Techniques
✅ Voting Classifier
Used soft voting with base models: Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest.

Accuracy: ~84%, consistent across multiple runs.

✅ Bagging
Test with BaggingClassifier using the same base models (LogReg, SVM, RF).

Result: No significant improvement in performance; accuracy remained at ~84%.

✅ Stacking
Applied StackingClassifier with base estimators: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest.

Meta-model (final estimator): Logistic Regression.

Result: Accuracy remained at ~84%, with no major improvements.

🔁 Cross-Validation
5-Fold Cross-Validation for better generalization.

Mean Accuracy: ~84%, with minimal standard deviation.

📌 Key Insights
Family history of mental illness is a strong factor in both depression and suicidal ideation.

85.44% of depressed individuals report having suicidal thoughts.

24% of people suffering from depression are in Class 12.

Data quality matters: Removing noisy city data (e.g., "Khaziabad", "Less Delhi") improved clarity.

Final conclusion: 84% seems to be the best achievable accuracy with the given dataset, though improvements could be explored with more advanced methods (e.g., deep learning).

🛠️ Libraries Used
pandas, numpy

matplotlib, seaborn

scikit-learn

🚀 Future Work
Deep Learning: Explore MLP, LSTM (if time-series data available).

Model Interpretability: Use SHAP or LIME for better model understanding.

Web App: Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit for easy access.

Conclusion:
This project shows the strong relationship between depression, suicidal thoughts, and family history of mental illness. With the current dataset, the best achievable accuracy is around 84%, which is good but leaves room for future improvements with more advanced methods or richer datasets.
